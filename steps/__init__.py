"""Initializer for ZenML steps.

A step is a single piece or stage of a ZenML pipeline. Think of each step as
being one of the nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (or DAG). Steps are
responsible for one aspect of processing or interacting with the data /
artifacts in the pipeline.

Conceptually, a Step is a discrete and independent part of a pipeline that is
responsible for one particular aspect of data manipulation inside a ZenML
pipeline.

Steps can be subclassed from the `BaseStep` class, or used via our `@step`
decorator.
