### What is ZenML?
ZenML is an extensible, open source MLOps framework for building production-ready ML pipelines. Designed for data scientists, it has a simple, flexible syntax, is cloud and tool agnostic, and has interfaces/abstractions geared towards ML workflows.

# 1. MLOps Notebooks
This folder contains a series of short practical MLOps notebooks about ZenML and its various integrations. It is intended for people who want to learn about MLOps in general, as well as ML practitioners who want to get started with ZenML.

### Objective

* Define an MLOps stack tailored to your project requirements.
* Create seamless, repeatable data-centric ML pipelines with automated artifact versioning, tracking, caching, and more.
* Deploy ML pipelines using the tools and infrastructure of your choice (e.g., as a serverless microservice in the cloud).
* Monitor and troubleshoot production issues, such as training data bias and data drift.
* Use some of the most popular MLOps tools such as ZenML, MLflow, Weights & Biases and many others.

### Steps
The folder is divided into several notebooks :

| 1. ML Pipelines	| 2. Training / Serving	| 3. Data Management	|
|---------------- | ----------------------| --------------------|
| 1.1 ML Pipelines| 2.1 Experiment Tracking|	3.1 Data Skew|
| 1.2 Artifact Lifecycle| 2.2 Local Deployment| |		
| | 2.3 Inference Pipelines| |
